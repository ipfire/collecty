TODO LIST

	Things we have to do in order of importance.

	* Asynchronously write data to RRDs. (Data is written when collected ATM.)
	* Fix signal handling.
		* Exit all threads on SIGTERM (Call shutdown method).
	* Fork daemon on startup.
	* Improve RRD format (choice of steps, etc.)

	* Better error handling of mistakes in the config file.

	* Write more plugins.
		* CPU Usage (almost done).
		* Load Average (almost done).
		* Memory Usage (almost done).
		* Disk space (with standby).
		* Network usage:
			Bridge (AREA) plus slave interfaces in the same graph (LINE).

		* (QoS - very expensive work.)
